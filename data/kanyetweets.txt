Power to the people. Power to the artist. Empower the artist and create a more inspired world.

Ask yourself Why did you love music in the first place and what can you do to add to the story.

Me and Drake both listen to Frank.  Radio has to support amazing artists.

Every station across the globe.  I Heart. Clear Channel local stations. Satellite. Every station.  This will make the world better.

If anyone at radio really loves music ... Come together and pick your favorite Frank Ocean song and play it at least 10 times a day.

Royre doesn't make a Polar bear bed but the Polar bear couch is my favorite piece of furniture we own https://t.co/tSJgikAUmT

and also my number one design rule of anything I do from shoes to music to homes is that Kim has to like it....

plus when you sit on the platform your calf is sort of half on half off

I love Rick Owens bed design but the back is too high for the beams and angle of the ceiling

I've been trying to figure out the bed design for the master bedroom at our Hidden Hills compound... https://t.co/aEPqoBGY4b

Thats all it was Kanye

Man that'd be so Kanye

Called I Miss the Old Kanye

What if Kanye made a song about Kanye

I even had the pink polo I thought I was Kanye

I  used to love Kanye

I used to love Kanye

And now I look and look around and theres so many Kanyes

It wasnt any Kanyes

See I invented Kanye

I gotta say at that time Id like to meet Kanye

Chop up the beats Kanye

I miss the sweet Kanye

Spaz in the news Kanye

The always rude Kanye

The bad mood Kanye

I hate the new Kanye

Set on his goals Kanye

Chop up the soul Kanye

Straight from the Go Kanye

I miss the old Kanye
