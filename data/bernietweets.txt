1 of 5 Americans age 19-64 cannot afford their prescriptions. Meanwhile, the 5 largest drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.

29 American CEOs receive higher salaries than what their companies pay in federal income tax. If you ask me, that number should be zero.

By closing loopholes that let companies stash profits abroad, we could save taxpayers almost $700 billion. Thats our whole defense budget.

ARIAD's outrageous sales tactics indicate it is more concerned with its profit than with its patients.

Taxpayers in America subsidize CEO bonuses and corporate profits stashed overseas. To me, that is just plain wrong.

We need a tax code that asks the wealthy, like Donald Trump, to pay their fair share and stop burdening the middle class.

Corporations may dodge their taxes legally, but that doesnt mean its acceptable for taxpayers to have to shoulder the burden.

I think it is reasonable to demand that a full time job pay enough to lift a worker out of poverty, not keep them in it.

This country has already seen centuries of racism. The last thing we need is politicians promoting bigotry.
