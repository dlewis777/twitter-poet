We'll make our economy and country more welcoming to people with disabilities. We all win when everyone gets to share in America's promise.

The ultimate test of our society is how we treat our fellow human beings, especially those who we have previously left behind.

Americans with disabilities deserve the chance to work alongside those without disabilitiesto do the same jobs for the same pay &amp; benefits.

Weve got to build an economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.

Over 60% of adults with disabilities arent in the workplace. We have to fix that. https://t.co/J3Jq21ejtR

None of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.

Building an inclusive economy is another reason weve got to break down systemic racism, including under-investment in communities of color.

When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.

In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you.

We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.

We've also seen the targeting of police officersbut so many serve every day with courage and honor and are committed to reform.

We have two names to add to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. Its unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable.

We're facing a candidate with a history of discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, and led the birther movement.

In a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside-in and the inside-out.

Simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. https://t.co/oZIm2is1lX

Optimism, not resentment.
Answers, not anger.
Ideas, not insults.

What Trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. Apologize to the President, and to the American people.

Trumps birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can't be undone.

The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can't be unwritten.

Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can't just take it back.

This shouldn't have to be said: You dont just get to say someone else did the worst things youve done. It doesnt work. No one buys it.

Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it "projecting." Kids call it "I'm rubber, you're glue." https://t.co/lKDDD0wwsn

When Trump tries to deflect blame for denying that @POTUS was born in America, he is lying. https://t.co/lje3lKrZQy https://t.co/yq9IWnvXUc

Leading the birther movement is deplorable. Attempting to say it "did a great service" to the president who Trump attacked is asinine.

Expressing zero regret for years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory, Trump again appointed himself judge &amp; jury on @POTUS's citizenship.

What Trump just did is a disgrace.

Lets build a future where love trumps hate. https://t.co/tTgeqxNqYm

Lets reject the cynicism, the bullying, and the divisive rhetoric that my opponent is using to try and make us all afraid of each other.

"Donald Trump looks at a distinguished judge born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. Hillary

Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
We just cant accept this.
Weve got to stand up to this.
If we dont, it wont stop.

Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple.

Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.

When will he stop this ugliness?

America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.

Despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.

No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.

"We have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isnt just the smart thing to doits what the American people demand."

Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isnt a luxuryits a necessity.

It's wrong when Latinos are 17% of our population and hold only 2% of its wealth.

3. While refusing to release your tax returns, how will you confirm that you do not have dangerous financial ties to bad actors abroad?

2. How will you handle non-cancelable contractual obligations with parties whose interests conflict with those of the United States?

1. Will you sever ties with your company linked to foreign leaders, questionable organizations, and criminals if you become president?

In light of @kurteichenwald's report on the Trump Organization's dangerous ties, here are 20 questions that Trump needs to answernow.

"Every day, more Americans are standing up and saying 'enough is enough'including a lot of Republicans. Im honored to have their support."

In 2008, John McCain told his own supporters that Barack Obama is an American citizen and "a decent person."

The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims 'love America just as much as I do.'

20 years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the Party to get out.

Theres an old Mexican proverb that says Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are.

"In times like these, we need a president who can help pull us together, not split us apart. I will work every single day to do just that."

White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day.

"Ending systemic racism requires contributions from us all, especially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves." Hillary

People who care about protecting the lives of police officers should be committed to getting assault weapons off our streets.

Fixing the mass incarceration crisis.
Dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline.
Helping the formerly incarcerated.

It's time to act.

We must fight for criminal justice reform. Everyone is safer when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.

"Perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better."

"Killing police officers is a terrible crime...anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable." Hillary

These things can be true at once:

We need criminal justice reform.

We need to support police.

We need to do more to stop gun violence.

The vast majority of gun owners agree: we have to prevent gun violence.

If were looking for common ground, this is common ground.

We need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve.

"We need to listen to those who say 'Black Lives Matter.' Too many black Americans...feel like their lives are disposable." Hillary

Gun violence is ripping apart peoples lives. They are trying to tell us. We need to listen. Hillary

Alton and Philando's deaths are the latest in a long, painful litany of African Americans killed in police incidents123 so far this year.

There is clear evidence that black Americans are more likely to be killed in police incidents than any other group. We have to do better.

There is something wrong with our country. There is too much violence...too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldnt be.
